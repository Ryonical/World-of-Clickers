World of Clickers 2

A Java clicker game where monsters endlessly respawn â€” and power grows without limit.

Overview

World of Clickers 2 is a text-based incremental clicker game built entirely in Java. Players defeat endlessly respawning monsters by attacking manually or recruiting allies who automatically assist in battle. Progress is fueled by a Recombobulate System which acts as a prestige mechanism allowing players to reset their progress for lasting power boosts and faster growth in future runs.

The interface follows a clean, text-based design with buttons for player actions and offers real-time feedback on stats including health and damage. The focus is on responsive gameplay logic and balance rather than visuals, delivering a streamlined and strategic clicker experience.

About the Project

World of Clickers 2 was one of my early Java projects an experimental step into more complex programming concepts like game loops, timers, and progression systems. It was created as a personal passion project to explore how incremental mechanics could be built from the ground up. The lessons learned from this project later influenced the design and structure of future projects such as BoxIt.
